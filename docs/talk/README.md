This folder contains the slides we used as part of the talk at ICML.  

Saved is the PDF of the slide deck.  However, this converts the videos and GIFs to still frames.  The full slide deck is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BpuXbPZsIXwLCQYxTjQg6c_piSAAUspu8u95jSTUzao/edit?usp=sharing).  Most of the materials contained within the presentation are in the figures directory one directory level above.

Once the final video has been released, we will link to it here.
